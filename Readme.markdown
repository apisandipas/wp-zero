# CSS Conventions #

There aren't many CSS conventions that Zero uses, it keeps a very small footprint on your styles. But there is one
to keep because it results in less work. Use the class name 'prose' to mark the element that contains body content 
such as the content of a post, page, or comment. Place all the prose styles in css/prose.less. This automatically 
gets pulled in to the editor for styling the output.

# Header and footers #

You should not need to modify the footer.php or header.php templates because they only handle the doctype, head element, body element, and html element. 
To modify the start and end of the page, you can over-ride the body-header.php and body-footer.php templates.
