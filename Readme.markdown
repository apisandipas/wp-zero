# General Features: #

1. HTML5
2. Small template footprint meaning fewer templates you have to over-ride
3. Built with Compass and Sass.

# Advance Features (they can be disabled): #

1. Apple touch icons: Simple place your icons in your sub-theme's image directory and name them ```apple-touch-icon[-<X>x<Y>][-precomposed].png```. (Use the App icon template to assist: http://appicontemplate.com/)

2. Favicon: Simple place your favicon.ico in your sub-theme's image directory.

3. Base CSS: The basic CSS structure is setup of reset.scss, screen.scss, print.scss, and prose.less which you can override by creating files of the same name in your CSS directory.

4. Editor CSS: By using the convention of using the prose class name to signal body-content, the WYSIWYG editor is automatically kept up-to-date in styles. It loads reset.less, editor.less, and prose.less into the WYSIWYG.

9. Comments: Generate the comment tree with HTML5 elements and gain better control of comment themeing with Zero_Walker_Comment walker class.

10. Page title: Adds a function zero_wp_title() with hook zero_wp_title to remove page title logic from the header.php.

11. Threaded comments script: Adds WordPress' comment-reply script for moving the reply form below the comment replying to.

12. Widget areas: Wraps the handling of registering widget areas.

13. Post thumbnail: Wraps the handling of configuring the thumbnail size.

# CSS Conventions #

There aren't many CSS conventions that Zero uses, it keeps a very small footprint on your styles. But there is one
to keep because it results in less work. Use the class name 'prose' to mark the element that contains body content 
such as the content of a post, page, or comment. Place all the prose styles in css/prose.less. This automatically 
gets pulled in to the editor for styling the output.

# Header and footers #

You should not need to modify the footer.php or header.php templates because they only handle the doctype, head element, body element, and html element. 
To modify the start and end of the page, you can over-ride the body-header.php and body-footer.php templates.

# Helpers #

## Load templates while passing variables ##

It works like the WordPress core ```load_template``` function but this takes an additional parameter of custom variables.

```php
<?php
zero_load_template( locate_template( 'custom-template.php' ),  array( 'foo' => 'The value for the $foo var in the template' ) );
?>
```


## Load a template part with multiple specialized names  ##

It works like the WordPress core ```get_template_part``` function but this takes an array for the ```$name``` parameter.

```php
<?php
zero_get_template_part( 'loop', array( 'single-event', 'event', 'single' ) );
?>
```

## Slugify text ##

1. ```$text``` string - the text to slugify
2. ```$options``` optional array - ```force_lowercase``` boolean to lowercase the text (defaults to ```true```), ```separated_character``` is a string to separate words (defaults to ```'-'```), ```accepted_characters``` is the regex to match words (defaults to ```'\w'```)

```php
<?php
$slug = zero_slugify( 'Magazine Name' );
echo $slug;
// magazine-name
?>
```

## Format array as HTML attributes ##

```php
<div <?php echo zero_get_formatted_attributes( array( 'class' => array('first', 'push1', 'span3'), 'id' => 'album', 'data-name' => 'french' ) ); ?>>
```
